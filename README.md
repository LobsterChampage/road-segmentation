# Road segmentation

This file will take you through the code used to create a machine learning model that performs road segmentation.

## Architecture
* You can find the weights of the best performing model the folder in weights
* In the submission folder, you will find the submission file in which obtained the best overall rank at AIcrowd (#169431)
* The folder predictions contains the predictions as images for our best submission
* We created our own submission to mask based on given code
* functions.py consist of helper functions
* training and test_set_images are unchanged
* The model itself is in the model folder
* 13_Final.ipynb is the notebook which shows our best model

## In order to run run.py

* pip install tensorflow-addons
* Run the file run.py

Version of tensorflow: 2.7
